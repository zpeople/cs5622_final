Replicating what's in the Kaggle kernel or other notebooks available online is not a valid project. It is reasonable to add different approaches and compare them with the Kaggle kernel or other notebooks available online. It is also good to find a research paper, implement an algorithm, and run experiments comparing its performance to different algorithms.  "
